                Hi, My name is Callum Alexander, I am an incoming 3rd year undergraduate studying Informatics (Computer Science)
                at the University of Edinburgh. I have academic interests in data science, artificial intelligence, and
                software engineering.
                <br><br>
                I am the Website & Publicity Secretary for Edinburgh University Men's
                Hockey Club, the most successful university men's hockey club in Scotland, and the largest university hockey
                club in the United Kingdom. My role is to manage the image of the club and perform outreach, via our website 
                and social media pages. I headed the first major update to the Club's website in 7 years.

                <br><br>
                From January til June 2021, I was a Quality Assurance Engineer at HYPED, where I helped develop a testing
                framework for the 16,000+ line C++ codebase.
                <br><br>
                When I manage to free up some time from studying and working, 
                I play hockey for Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club, read Brian Herbert and other authors,
                and nunchucks, and write scripts to display
                Cowsay quoting Sacha Baron Cohen.
                <br>
                Recently, I have switched from Fedora 43 to Ubuntu LTS, and begun 'ricing' my OS. My workspace is in a constantly
                changing cycle between GNOME and Qtile WM. 
                <br> 
                I am an Asura Ranger found exploring on Fisher of Woe, a very budget FIFA player, and
                a half-decent Mario Kart Wii player with Funky Kong and the Bowser Bike.
