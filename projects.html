                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <p>I had a driving test booked for sometime in July a few years back, can't remember the date well.
                    I sat the test, and failed on my first attempt. I was gutted at the result.
                    However, I was in a difficult situation. I was only able to resit my practical in the next few months, or certain
                    circumstances would mean I would have to delay my sitting until the following year. Furthermore, I could only really
                    sit the test at the test centre I was already registered with. To top it off it was summer, so the amount of 17 and 18
                    year olds looking to pass during the holidays increased the demand for tests. I really was in a tight situation.
                    What I needed was a cancellation. <br>
                    I booked my test on the earliest possible date, which was a month after I was available to sit the test. However, I needed to 
                    book some date in order to browse for cancellations. <br>
                    I simply couldn't afford to sit checking for cancellations every hour of every day, especially when I was working. So I 
                    wrote a script to do it for me</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>I was familiar with web scraping and web crawling, so I wondered if there was a way to scrape month of the closest
                    available cancellation date from the web and alert me if it was a suitable date to book. Sounds simple. <br>
                    So I got to work. <br>
                    I downloaded chromedriver and hooked it up to my chrome browser. I also pip installed selenium, which was my 
                    web automation tool of choice, and finally, booted up SpyderIDE - my ide and editor of choice at the time through conda -
                    since this whole script would be implemented using Python. Boom boom boom. Easy stuff. <br>
                    My first task was to set up a method that would run through step by step the login process to the website. This process
                    I broke down to running the browser, finding the login elements, enter the login data, logining in, clicking the 
                    change booking date, clicking the earliest available date, clicking another botton (ik this seems long, but is actually
                    a really short process irl), and finally finding the month of the earliest available date and returning it. <br>
                    whew <br>
                    Then, I wrote a simple main loop that loops forever, checking whether the month returned is an ideal month - July or August,
                    then implementing sleep method to delay each time the program checks.
                    When an ideal month is found, a python library for conventiently playing mp3s plays some sound. <br>
                    Some of the code in the accompanying github has been changed to hide my passwords and login info, that is why it's a copy
