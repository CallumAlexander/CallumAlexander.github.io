        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>I had a driving test booked for sometime in July a few years back, can't remember the date well.
            I sat the test, and failed on my first attempt. I was gutted at the result but failing first time isn't uncommon.
            However, I was in a difficult situation. I was only able to resit my practical in the next few months, or certain
            circumstances would mean I would have to delay my sitting until the following year. Furthermore, I could only really
            sit the test at the test centre I was already registered with. To top it off it was summer, so the amount of 17 and 18
            year olds looking to pass during the holidays increased the demand for tests. I really was in a tight situation.
            What I needed was a cancellation. <br>
            I booked my test on the earliest possible date, which was a month I was available to sit the test. However, I needed to 
            book some date in order to browse for cancellations. <br>
            I simply couldn't afford to sit checking for cancellations every hour of every day, especially when I was working. So I 
            wrote a script to do it for me
