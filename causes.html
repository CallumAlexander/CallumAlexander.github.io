        Here is a repository of links and resources relating to charities, non-profits,
        petitions for change etc, that I actively believe in. <br>
        I will attempt to keep it well updated. <br>

        <p>
            As a member of Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club, Action for Children is one of our partner charities
            that we raise awareness and money for throughout the season. During May 2020, the Club started a fundraiser where
            each of our seven teams would race each other across the distance between our home pitches, Peffermill, and Lloret
            de Mar, where the club was meant to have their hockey tour. <br>
            Action for Children work to support disadvantaged young people through difficult and turbulant times in their lives.
