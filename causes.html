            Here is a repository of links and resources relating to charities, non-profits,
            petitions for change etc, that I actively believe in or have worked with in the past. <br>
            I will attempt to keep it well updated. <br>

                    As a member of Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club, Action for Children is one of our partner charities
                    that we raise awareness and money for throughout the season. During May 2020, the Club started a fundraiser where
                    each of our seven teams would race each other across the distance between our home pitches, Peffermill, and Lloret
                    de Mar, where the club was meant to have their hockey tour. <br>
                    Action for Children work to support disadvantaged young people through difficult and turbulant times in their lives.

                    It's in the Bag is a testicular cancer charity based in south-west England that raise awareness and support
                    for testicular cancer. <br>
                    As a member of Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club, during November I attempt to grow some form of facial
                    hair on my upper lip (usually with little success lol) in order to raise awareness and support for It's in
                    the Bag.
