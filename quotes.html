            This is a page where I will try and paste as many cool, funny, interesting, thought-provoking,
            philosophical, or motivational quotes, song lyrics, and one liners. This was taken from a pinterest pin
            that I unfortiunately didn't save (if anyone know what I'm talking about, please slide into my dms). The
            pin showed an interior design idea (I'm not into interior design, it just happened) where the wall was covered
            in quotes written with sharpe and permamarker. This is my replication of it! Enjoy xx
